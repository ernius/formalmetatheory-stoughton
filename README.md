# Formal Meta Theory of Lambda Calculus based on Stoughton's multiple substitutions operation.

We develop metatheory of the Lambda calculus in Constructive Type Theory, using the presentation of the former with one sort of names for both free and bound variables and without identifying terms up to &#945;-conversion. We prove three substitution lemmas: for &#945;-conversion, for parallel &#946;-reduction and for the system of simple type assignment. This shows that the approach scales up to the main results of the metatheory, which is made possible by the use of an appropriate notion of substitution, due to A. Stoughton. The whole development has been machine-checked using the system Agda. The whole work is web browsable [here](http://ernius.github.io/formalmetatheory-stoughton/).
